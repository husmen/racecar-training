# Kalman Filter as Recursive Bayesian Estimation
This is a step by step tutorial from histogram filters to N dimensional Kalman Filters.

It is based on the excelent Udacity course given by Sebastian Thrun:

https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs373/

It covers:
- [Histogram Filters](https://github.com/jganzabal/Kalman-as-Recursive-Bayesian-Estimation/blob/master/1_Histogram%20Filters.ipynb)
- [Additive noise histogram filters](https://github.com/jganzabal/Kalman-as-Recursive-Bayesian-Estimation/blob/master/2_Additive%20noise%20Histogram%20Filters.ipynb)
- [One dimensional Kalman Filters](https://github.com/jganzabal/Kalman-as-Recursive-Bayesian-Estimation/blob/master/3_One%20dimensional%20Kalman%20filter.ipynb)
- [N dimensional Kalman filters](https://github.com/jganzabal/Kalman-as-Recursive-Bayesian-Estimation/blob/master/4_Two%20dimensional%20Kalman%20filter.ipynb)
