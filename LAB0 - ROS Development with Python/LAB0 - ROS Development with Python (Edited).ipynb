    "ROS is a software that is widely used in robots. ROS's purpose is to develop a piece of software that can work on other robots by making very little changes to the code. Thanks to ROS, a standard algorithm written for a standard robot will be able to run at load-and-use speed. The data from the robotic sensors will be sent to the computer via ROS. The data processed on the computer will be returned to robot as task. \n",
    "This communication system will be done with the help of topics and messages in the ROS interface. ROS works to compatible with the Gazebo simulation environment. In this way, the Gazebo simulation environment can be used for rapid development to test the data structure of the project into prototype stage ROS Package.\n",
